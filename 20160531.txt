The wind is really strong today.
There was a hurricane down south.
The fog is so bad today.
There was a little frost last night.
Watch out for thar ice on the road.
The south has hot weather now.
We're finally getting some cool weather.
What's the temperature today?
How many degrees is it at night?
It's 30 degrees Celsius out today!
My car is the black one.
Can I borrow your brown sweater?
She's going to dye her hair pink.
I can't find my red hat anywhere.
It's the man with the yellow hat.
He has dreamy green eyes.
I painted my room walls purple.
Where are your silver shoes?
Does this necklace match my coral dress?
Look, he is all in navy blue.
